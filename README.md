# Webcam Face Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

## Overview

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to perform real-time face detection through a webcam feed. The program captures frames from the webcam, detects faces in each frame using the MediaPipe Face Detection module, and overlays rectangles around the detected faces on the live video stream.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
