# Webcam Face Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

## Overview

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to perform real-time face detection through a webcam feed. The program captures frames from the webcam, detects faces in each frame using the MediaPipe Face Detection module, and overlays rectangles around the detected faces on the live video stream.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python face_detection.py
Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

Description
The script initializes the webcam using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture(0)).
It sets up the MediaPipe Face Detection module for face recognition.
The script continuously captures frames from the webcam and processes them to detect faces.
Detected faces are outlined with rectangles, and the processed frames are displayed in a window titled "Webcam Faces."
Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.
